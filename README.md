      <h1>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: My Favorite Sport
      </h1>
      <h3>Why Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is an Amazing Sport</h3>
      <p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is an amazing sport that can be done by anyone, and it gets really fun when you start to get really good at it! Being a super technical sport, the main principal of the sport is correct technique over all, meaning somebody who is smaller can absolutely defeat someone of greater size if they are equipped with better technique (even though there are limits to that). Some may argue that the sport is "too violent." However, with no actual strikes being thrown in this sport, how can it possibly be violent? Many tend to confuse this with karate, although they are completely different sports. </p>
