      <h1>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu: My Favorite Sport
      </h1>
      <h2>Why Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is an Amazing Sport</h2>
      <p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is an amazing sport that can be done by anyone, and it gets really fun when you start to get really good at it! Being a super technical sport, the main principal of the sport is correct technique over all, meaning somebody who is smaller can absolutely defeat someone of greater size if they are equipped with better technique (even though there are limits to that). Many tend to confuse this with karate, although they are completely different sports. It's often the similar outfits that confuse people, or the "gi." However, there is a form of jiu jistu that involves no gi, and it is called: nogi. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a grappling heavy sport in which most events occur on the ground, as there are many positions and transitions only people who are well trained would know. Some may argue that the sport is "too violent." However, with no actual strikes being thrown in this sport, how can it possibly be violent?

      <h3>Professional Aspect: Different Perspective?</h3>
      <p>Professional Brazilian Jiu Jitsu athletes have one goal: to become a World Champion. There are 2 major seasons for Jiu Jitsu (gi and nogi), one in the first half of the year, and the other in the 2nd. The first season is gi season, which lasts from January-June, and nogi is July-December. Many of these athletes, alike other athletes, take the sport extremely serious, training multiple times a day every day without any breaks. As someone who goes through a similar schedule and being behind the scenes experiencing the work that these athletes put in is admirable. There are days where the last thing the athlete wants to do is wake up at 5:00 am to train, but they'll do it anyway, and will overcome those daily and constant battles almost every time. A lot of these professional athletes were born in Brazil, as they decided from a young age that this was going to be their profession. Seeing the determination and dedication that an athlete dedicates to their respective sports, another level of respect is always associated with people like that. </p>
